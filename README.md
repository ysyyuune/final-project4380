# final-project4380
This is Siyu Yao's final project for course: Intro to VR

Introduction:
This is a chemical lab simulation. Players can mix the chemicals on the table, and the formula of the reaction will show at the top of
the screen. Players can use X button to grab things to their right hands and Y button to grab things to their left hands. If there is only
one chemical in their hands, or the chemicals in their hands cannot react, it will show "you don't have enough chemicals" at the top of the
screen.
